    <h1>Our Students' Math Journey</h1>
    <p>The diagram below describes the path 
    taken by the 4232 students who 
    started at LaGuardia in Fall 2012 and took
    a math class. It describes the flow of students
     during their first two math classes.</p>
     <p>When a student reaches "END" it means they 
     never took a math class at LaGuardia again</p>
